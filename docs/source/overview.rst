Overview
========

The HDL languages Verilog and VHDL 

Objectives
----------

* Make large systems easier to understand
* Leverage information to reduce workload


* Can we model an HDL system using a higher level language?
* Can we then leverage the model to make portions of the design effort easier?

I want to create a model of a multi FPGA system and visualize it using a graph.

Objects will be represented by classes.
