Design Explorer (DE) is a tool to assist in the design phase of an HDL design.
It will 

Design Explorer is an attempt to answer these questions:

#. Can we model an HDL system using a higher level language?
#. Can we then leverage the model to make portions of the design effort easier?

Features
--------

* Quick design changes
* visualize different aspects of the design
* Automatically create design heirarchy files
* Route signals between HDL components
* Route signals through hierarchy
* Generate graphs at different hierarchy levels

Objectives
----------

* Make large systems easier to understand
* Leverage information to reduce workload
* Minimize impacts of design changes
* Block diagrams always up to date
